>“We are all travelers in the wilderness of this world, and the best we can find in our travels is an honest friend.” ― Robert Louis Stevenson*

Our TravelScape Full-Stack Project opens up communication between travelers near and far. Here, your vacation stories come to life and inspire adventures for the friends you make along the way. From tales of the well-traveled to dream vacations shared by the wanderer-at-heart, our goal is that every page will take you on a new journey.

* Post, read, and delete articles
* Add comments, likes and followers dynamically

### Feature Spotlight
* We implemented functionality for users to post, read, and delete articles. One of our challenges was specifiying the correct paths each button would take, and keeping them organized for a better UI experience. Having each member review and revise routes periodically helped us execute this.
* We implemented dynamic funtionality for users to comment and like articles, and follow and unfollow profiles. One of our challenges was consistently isolating the correct keys and values we wanted to change. Having our team collectively brainstorm bug by bug helped achieve our end goal.
